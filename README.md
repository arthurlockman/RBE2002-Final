RBE 2002 Final Project Code
===
This code will be used to run our WPI RBE 2002 final project. The project that we will be completing is the Fire Fighting challenge. For the challenge, the robot needs to navigate around a field autonomously, find a small candle, and extinguish it. 

We are accomplishing this task by using an Arduino to control the robot drive and detection system, and a Raspberry Pi to control the arduino itself. The Raspberry Pi runs a small NodeJS server that handles remote control of the robot and output at the end of the task.
